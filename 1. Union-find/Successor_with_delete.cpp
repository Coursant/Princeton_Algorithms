/*
Statement of the problem:
Successor with delete. Given a set of N integers S={0, 1, ..., Nâˆ’1} and a sequence of requests of the following form:
    - Remove x from S
    - Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y >= x.

Design a data type so that all operations (except construction) should take logarithmic time or better.
*/

/*
Solution: We use the structure of Weighted Quick Union-Find. 
		  We hold an extra array where we remember the successor.
		  The successor of each element of a given tree will be the largest element in the tree.
		  
		  At initialization, every node is their own successor.
		  
		  When we remove an element i, we create a link between i and i+1. The successor of i becomes equal to the successor of i+1. We are updating only the successors of the roots.
		  
		  When we remove i = n-1, there is no successor. We indicate this by setting the successor = n.
