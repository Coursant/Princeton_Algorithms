The folder contains:

(i) Data structures to solve the problems in Deques_and_Radomized_Queues.pdf: RandomizedQueue.h and List.h (List.h mimics 
the implementation of the list template class in C++, not of deque; the performance requirements specified in 
Deques_and_Radomized_Queues.pdf are satisfied, but those of the deque template class in C++ are not satisfied because it doesn't allow
random access iterators, for example.)

(ii) Solutions to interview questions: stack_with_max.cpp and queue_with_2_stacks.cpp
