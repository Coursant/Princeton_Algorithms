The folder contains:

(i) Data structures List.h and RandomizedQueue.h described in Deques_and_RandomizedQueues.pdf (class List satisfies the requirements for 
Deque as described in Deques_and_RandomizedQueues.pdf, but it is the implementation of the doubly-linked list in C++, not of a deque in C++;
for example, the data structure does not support random access)

(ii) Solutions to interview questions: queues_with_2_stacks.cpp and stack_with_max.cpp
